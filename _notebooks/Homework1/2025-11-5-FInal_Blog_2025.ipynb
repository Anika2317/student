    "\n",
    "With help from my amazing team, **The Constellators**, I learned how to use **GitHub** and **VS Code** properly. I can see how far I've come - from struggling to even open a notebook to building real, working projects that I'm proud of.\n",
    "## Sprint 1 Reflection: My Learning Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting Sprint 1, I quickly realized this sprint was not just about coding—it was about learning to think like a Learning Experience Designer. As you explored the ideas of divergant thinking, I got used to thinking more creativley.  Setup challenges such as cloning repositories and from logging into VSCode to GitHub Pages eventually made me a better student."
